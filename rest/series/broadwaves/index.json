It is about the characters within that system, lawyers, judges and public alike, who range from the desperate to the bizarre.\n\nThis show is about the warmth, humanity and diversity of the characters. It is about the tenaciousness of the human spirit, about compassion and kindness, and sometimes just plain idiocy. Sometimes, it's so painful it's funny.\n\nIn this episode of __Broadwaves__, we introduce you to This is Wonderland, and we do it without giving away any major spoilers - because if you haven't seen it yet, we want you to watch it.\n\nMusic used in this episode:\n* Broadwaves theme tune\n  * Tishiana Girls by Great Big Sea\n",

The letters instruct her to change the future, to prevent the death of someone important to her, a boy name Kukiru.\n\nBut it's not as easy as it sounds. Future-Naho only knows what went wrong, not how to do it right, and the more present-Naho changes things, the less useful the letters become. She's going to have to rely on her wits, and her friends, and her love, and most importantly, she's going to have to need courage.\n\nIn this episode of __Broadwaves__, we dive deeper, and discuss what our crew thought of this show. There will be spoilers! Join in the discussion.\n\nWhere to find Orange:\n  * [Crunchyroll](https://www.crunchyroll.com/orange) (dubbed)\n  * [Funimation](https://www.funimationnow.uk/shows/orange/) (subtitled)\n\nMusic used in this episode:\n* Broadwaves theme tune\n  * \"Tishiana Girls\" by Great Big Sea\n",
